# My Cool Project
Hello git and **Github**

## __Palindrome__

## Something Else

Some _other_ __thing__ like fruits...

## __Code in Markdown__

When done with commits, make sure to run `git push` to move the code to GitHub.

Standard Git Repos have a `READ.md` at the root that describe developer instructions.

```
var x = 1 + 2;
```

## Some HTML
```html
<ul>
    <li>red</li>
    </ul>
```

## BONUS: Tables

Header1 | Header2
---|---
one| 1
two| 2
three| 3

## __This is a bold header__
_but with content in italics_
